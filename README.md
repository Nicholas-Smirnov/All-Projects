# List of Projects

Hello, my name is Nicholas Smirnov, and I program in Python, Html, Css, Javascript, and more. I am here to share some of my projects with you! Hope you enjoy these projects!

## Projects written in Python

### Competition Calculator

The competition calculator is a calculator in which you will alter the teams, their names, and their points, and it will automatically return a table of values. You can choose to sort these values in order. In addition, you can choose from either calculating the average of the points or the sum of the points or perhaps both. This is a good tool to use if you are a jury or a judge in a competition. The link to the calculator can be found either in the CompetitionCalculator folder, or [here](https://github.com/PythonCoderNick/Projects/tree/main/CompetitionCalculator).

### Discord Bot

Yes, this is a discord bot. This is of course a very simple and very basic tutorial and code on how to create a bot, however it is enough to create a fun bot. This discord bot can reply to messages and even work with some messages. The link to the discord bot can be found either in the DiscordBot folder, or [here](https://github.com/PythonCoderNick/Projects/tree/main/DiscordBot)
