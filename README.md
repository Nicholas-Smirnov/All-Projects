## Projects written in Python

### Competition Calculator

The competition calculator is a calculator in which you will alter the teams, their names, and their points, and it will automatically return a table of values. You can choose to sort these values in order. In addition, you can choose from either calculating the average of the points or the sum of the points or perhaps both. This is a good tool to use if you are a jury or a judge in a competition. The link to the calculator can be found either in the CompetitionCalculator folder or [here](https://github.com/PythonCoderNick/Projects/tree/main/CompetitionCalculator/CompetitionCalculator.py).

### Discord Bot

Yes, this is a discord bot. This is of course a very simple and very basic tutorial on how to create a bot, however it is enough to create a fun bot. This discord bot can reply to messages and even work with some messages. The link to the discord bot can be found either in the DiscordBot folder or [here](https://github.com/PythonCoderNick/Projects/tree/main/DiscordBot/DiscordBot.py).

### Image Editor

This is an image editor that can edit images based on your preferences. You can always change up anything you want. This is mostly for creating business images or images that are identical in style. Hope you have fun with this image editor. You can find the image editor in the folder called ImageEditor or [here]()
